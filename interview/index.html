<h2>My approach to interview tutoring</h2>
I am an experienced medical school interview tutor, with a strong interest in helping applicants identify and showcase their genuine values and strengths during the application process. I have been lucky to have the opportunity to refine my interview skills over the past 10 years both by preparing for and obtaining competitive grants, scholarships and positions and by assisting others to do the same. To my mind the key to performing well in medical school
interviews is developing an ability to genuinely known your own values, to have the flexibility of thought to consider the perspectives of others, and to apply structured and nuanced frameworks for responding to common question types. I typically run all my sessions as mock interviews with detailed feedback provided. I believe the best way to get good at interviews is by doing interview practice. 

<h2>About me</h2>
I am a junior doctor currently working across Darwin and the remote community of Nhulunbuy.  I studied medicine at the Australian National
University (ANU) graduating with a University Medal in 2023.  I was funded under a Willigobung Scholarship for the duration of my medical studies, a merit based scholarship awarded through a nationally competitive process.
<br>
I have a strong interest in social justice particularly in terms of refugee health and Indigenous health. I am a founding co-director of Canberraâ€™s only swimming program for refugees and migrants. I was a member of ANUs indigenous health stream and have published research in the area. 
<br>
Before medical school I coached and adjudicated debating for many years, an endeavour which helped me develop strong skills in generating structured responses on my feet to interview questions. 

<h2>Next steps</h2>
If you are interested in going ahead with a session book in below via email. I bill at $100/hr invoiced following the session. I have very limited availability - many students book weeks in advance and I only allocate 4hrs/week to this work.

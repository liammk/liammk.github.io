Time of death ___________________


I offered my condolences to the family. Family did not have any concerns over their care at this time. I have discussed patients death with the NIC, given I do not have detailed knowledge of their medical management and circumstances surrounding their death. The NIC informs me there is no indication for referral to the coroner.

I have not yet completed their death certificate at the time, and will opt to allow the home team to complete as they have the most knowledge surrounding their passing.

Rest in peace.
